# IMRead
Jailbreak tweak to mark messages as read automatically after clearing their notification

Compatible for use with [BadgeSync](https://github.com/waresnew/badgesync)

Note: Marking the latest message as read in a conversation will mark all older messages in that conversation read as well. This is just how IMCore works.

Special thanks to waresnew's BadgeSync for inspiration and itsjunetime's very helpful documentation on IMCore.
